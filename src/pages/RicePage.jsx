              various models to satisfy its paddy rice needs, customized to each
              catchmentâ€™s areas situation. Our grower program through direct
              outreach, Aggregation and Agent-based models will be the
              cornerstones (60% share) and are essential for a rapid scale-up.
              Own farms will be included to increase security of supply for
              which land has already been identified in Nasarawa. Open Market
              will be used to match supply to demand. This sourcing strategy

              over 100,000 farmers, and improve food security.
